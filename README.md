Here are my code in the practicum sessions during 2025 Summer School on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the Molecular Sciences held by NYU-ECNU Center for Computational Chemistry at NYUShanghai. 

# Topics
## Day1: Regression and Classification
Thanks **Jun Chen** from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences for providing starting code and led the session  
**Brief (1)**: Predicted activation energy of H-atom transfer (HAT) reaction using multiple regression models including neural-network, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost  
**Brief (2)**: Predicted activity of metal cluster catalyst of HAT reaction using multiple classification models including neural-network, Random Forest, and Supporting Vector Machine  
**Brief (3)**: Contructed Potential Energy Surface (PES) of H2+OH <-> H2O+H reaction using Gaussian Process and Neural Network  

## Day2: Learning Interatomic Potentials with MACE
Thanks **Jun Chen** from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences for providing starting code and led the session  
**Brief**: Train a MACE ML potential model using AMLP toolkit with DFT single-point data and perform MD simulations in comparison with first-principle trajectories  

## Day3: Transformer-based Molecular Structure Elucidation Using NMR Spectra
Thanks **Micheal Chen** from New York University and Simons Foundation for providing starting code and led the session  
**Brief**:Trained a multi-task model based on Encoder-Decoder Transformer architechure to elucidate molecular structure from NMR data  

Note: Unfortunately some uncompleted codes are **lost** in my old laptop, so the corresponding starting codes are provided instead.
